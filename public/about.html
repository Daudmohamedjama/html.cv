<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Daud Mohamed, originally from Somalia, and currently a student at Sakarya University.
   I'm passionate about learning and expanding my knowledge in various fields, and my time at university 
   has been a key part of my journey.  Juggling multiple roles and responsibilities, 
   I strive to make the most out of every opportunity, always aiming for success.

  Alongside my studies, I work as a freelance graphic designer.
   I love bringing creative ideas to life through design, helping clients communicate their messages visually. 
   On top of that, I'm also a full-stack web developer, with skills in both front-end and back-end development, 
   which enables me to create fully functional, dynamic websites.
  
  Balancing schoolwork with my freelance career keeps me on my toes, but I thrive on the challenge. 
  Whether it’s meeting tight deadlines for a project or preparing for exams, I’m always focused on doing 
  my best and achieving my goals in both my academic and professional life.</p>
